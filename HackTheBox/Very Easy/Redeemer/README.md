## About

Redeemer served as an introductory challenge focused on database services and basic Redis commands. The machine guided enumeration toward the Redis key-value store running on the target, highlighting common Redis interactions and information disclosure.

## Reconnaissance

An initial nmap scan using the Top 1024 ports revealed no open services. Expanding to a full port scan exposed port 6379 running _Redis 5.0.7_, a widely used key-value store.

Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value store that functions as a fast database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures and offers high performance for real-time applications due to its in-memory design.

## Redis Database

Using `redis-cli`, a connection to the Redis server was established. The `INFO` command provided detailed server metadata, including the Redis version, OS, process ID, and configuration details. The keyspace indicated 4 keys stored in database 0.

```bash
10.129.28.230:6379> info

# Keyspace

```
Further enumeration revealed the flag stored under the 3rd key, which was retrieved directly from the database.

## Conclusion

Redeemer emphasized the importance of recognizing default or exposed database services. Redis, when accessible without authentication, allows direct key inspection and data retrieval, which can expose sensitive information such as flags or credentials.
